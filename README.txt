Attack on Planet Earth is a remake of Space Invaders,
the well known arcade game.
AoPE is built using Python with heavy usage of the Pygame library.
AoPE is a Free to Develop, Free to Play game.

I have tried to convert the interpreted Python code
into a runnable exe file, but that has failed.
As such, future attempts to distribute the game to a wider
audience will be done by rewriting the whole game in JavaScript.

Planned features:
  extra lives
  powerups
  varied enemies
  storyline
  slightly improved graphics
